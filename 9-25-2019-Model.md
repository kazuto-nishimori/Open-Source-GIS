This week, I worked on a QGIS model to calculate the distance and direction of each census tract with respect to a point for a given input shape file. One or multiple features can be selected and the algorithm averages their centroids to create the origin. The centroid of each tract of the input layer is then used to calculate its distance and direction from this origin. A more in depth overview of its functions is written in the help page in the model. This model can be used, for example, in the study of urban geography when confirming the distance-decay model.

This exercise is part of my ongoing effort to familiarize myself with the ecosystem of open-source GIS software and the open-source community in general. In recent times, it is increasingly apparent that the status-quo of GIS must change in the field of geography – academic and otherwise. There are two major problems: the hegemony of the company ESRI and its software, notably ArcGIS, and the ideology of GIS as a science. I am hoping to address each of these problems through my exploration of the open-source world. 

The hegemony of ESRI is very apparent; their market share globally in GIS is almost 50% and many institutions, companies, and organizations require the knowledge and potentially a license of ArcGIS. This is a major issue, not just because an ArcGIS license costs several hundred dollars. It is also because of their marketing strategy that advertises their software as the one and only geospatial technology; a strategy that has worked to sell their product and delegitimize the open-source approach. In addition, ESRI projects the ideology that GIS is a science not a mere tool - that to use GIS is necessarily to ‘do science’. To put simply, ESRI wants the users to believe that GIS is science, and the only way to do science is to use ArcGIS. 

Open-source could be the antithesis of ESRI – the software is free, and it is developed by the users themselves. Every six months, QGIS, for example is updated with new features popularized by plugins or ‘forked’ versions of the software. Unlike ESRI, its code is accessible and free to modify, giving users control over their own software; proponents of this approach believe this to be an extension of the freedom of speech. Users can post of forums such as GitHub to request a tool that does not yet exist. Open-source understands the importance of accessibility to free tools and the right to modify them as needed. It also knows that using GIS and the scientific method are two distinct things, but a good scientist will modify their methods to suite their experiments. This project is just a beginning step for me to delve deeper into this new way of GIS.
