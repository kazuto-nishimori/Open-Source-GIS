This week, I worked on a QGIS model to calculate the distance and direction of each census tract with respect to a point for a given input shape file. One or multiple features can be selected and the algorithm averages their centroids to create the origin. The centroid of each tract of the input layer is then used to calculate its distance and direction from this origin. A more in depth overview of its functions is written in the help page in the model. This model can be used, for example, in the study of urban geography when confirming the distance-decay model.

This exercise is part of my ongoing effort to familiarize myself with the ecosystem of open-source GIS software and the open-source community in general. In recent times, it is increasingly apparent that the status-quo of GIS must change in the field of geography â€“ academic and otherwise. There are two major problems: the hegemony of the company ESRI and its software, notably ArcGIS, and the ideology of GIS as a science. I am hoping to address each of these problems through my exploration of the open-source world. 

The hegemony of ESRI is very apparent; their market share globally in GIS is almost 50% and many institutions, companies, and organizations require the knowledge of and potentially a license of ArcGIS. This is a major issue, not just because an ArcGIS license costs several hundreds of dollars. It is also because of their marketing strategy that advertises their software as the one and only true geospatial technology. To be continued
