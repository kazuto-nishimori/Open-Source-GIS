## Objective <a name="goal"></a>

The goal of this lab is to be acquainted with the open source GIS environment; this can mean several things. In a myopic sense, this means learning to use QGIS, an open source GIS software. However, ‘open source’ is so much more than the software per se: it signifies the whole ecosystem of professionals and hobbyists that engage in the bottom up, grassroots creation of useful tools. This environment revolves around online forums and repositories like Github. Therefore, getting acquainted with open source means creating a tool, publishing it on the web, and creating helpful documentation to allow others to use and modify it. This is precisely the goal of this lab.
