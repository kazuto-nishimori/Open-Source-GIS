## [Lab: Reproducibility, Replicability in Geography Research](/lab8)
This lab has two large goals. Firstly, we will reproduce a vulnerability map published in Applied Geography by Malcolm, Weaver, and Krakowka using the datasets and methodologies outlined in their article. Secondly, we will critique the methods used by the authors and discuss the broader issue of replicability in vulnerability analysis. This lab is an opportunity to dive deep into the reproducibility and replicability discussion that is becoming a hot issue in the social science community.

## [Lab: Web Mapping with Leaflet](/lab7/index.md)
Creating a ‘slippy’ webmap is very easy to do thanks to the myriad of opensource plugins and software that is available now. The two most popular are OpenLayers and Leaflet, which uses javascript files exported from QGIS layers to create a in-browser visualisation. The goal of this lab is to create this webmap. The steps are straightforward, but bugs and glitches are rather common. I will walk you through how I made this webmap.

## [Lab: OpenStreetMap Data on PostGIS](/lab6/index.md)
The goal of this lab is to use OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Tanzania Resilience Academy (RA) data to quantify a dimension of vulnerability, and create a visualization at the sub-ward level to aid policy action. I will specifically be looking at the vulnerability caused by the build-up of rubbish in areas that are near existing drain blockages, but are inaccessible by vehicle. The goal of my final visualization is to highlight the sub-wards that are in dire need of reviewing its road and trash-collection infrastructure to lower their vulnerability to the next big flood.

## [Lab: Global DEM and Error Propagation](/lab3)
This lab has two learning goals: 1) to become familiar with the open source terrain analysis software SAGA and 2) to learn to examine and compare raster datasets with a critical lens. SAGA is an opensource terrain analysis software has been around since 2004, and it is ideal for physical geography analysis using raster data. I will use two datasets, ASTER and SRTM, and through the analysis I will identify the dataset that is better suited for the study region.

## [Lab: Creating a QGIS Model: Introduction to Open Source](/lab1/index.md)
The goal of this lab is to be acquainted with the open source GIS environment; this can mean several things. In a myopic sense, this means learning to use QGIS, an open source GIS software. However, ‘open source’ is so much more than the software per se: it signifies the whole ecosystem of professionals and hobbyists that engage in the bottom up, grassroots creation of useful tools. This environment revolves around online forums and repositories like Github. Therefore, getting acquainted with open source means creating a tool, publishing it on the web, and creating helpful documentation to allow others to use and modify it. This is precisely the goal of this lab.
